Small project for accessing primesense/kinect using the libfreenect 0.1 drivers
Heavily relies on the Cinder-OpenNI repo


1 - install libusb
2 - Checkout submodules


It should work, and if if not...


Follow build instructions at
https://github.com/heisters/Cinder-OpenNI
https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect


-- if the included lib doesn't work right

::brew install libfreenect1.0::
cd /usr/local
git checkout 8bf7b7e Library/Formula/libfreenect.rb
brew install libfreenect --universal


If copying into a project be sure to do a copy phase of the dylibs
